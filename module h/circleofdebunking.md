## Instruction

1. Take a list of paper and a pen.
2. Write down 4–5 personal attributes that make you unique or that are a core part of your character or personality.
3. In 2 minutes per each attribute: write down some realistic events that might lead you to lose your abilities or will make them irrelevant or not so unique.
4. Reflect on the events list. How you live would change if that really will happen? Are you able to prevent or mitigate them?

## Example

1. I'm good at composing the big picture. -> Event: there are narrow time constraints, that excludes processing all the information.
2. I 2m tall. -> Event: broke my legs, height doesn't matter. Event: moved to a country of tall people like the Netherlands.

## Group variation (recommended): 

1. Pass the list with attributes to the next person. Get a similar list from the previous one.
2. In 2 minutes: each member of the group writes down the ideas for their current list. No events repeats are allowed.
3. Repeat the process. Finish when you get your list back.
